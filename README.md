# Sparkles: Stardust Labs Resourcepack
This is an **optional** resource pack for all of Stardust Labs' projects! Here are the main features:
- Custom mob/item textures for Incendium
- A fix to allow biome names to show on minimaps and similar mods
- Translations for Incendium, and all future projects in need of them

## Why can't I see some textures?
In order to see the custom textures/models for the mobs, shields, and Elytra, you must use a mod that supports custom entity textures. For **Forge**, you can use Optifine or an equivalent. For **Fabric**, download all of the following:
- [CIT Resewn](https://modrinth.com/mod/cit-resewn)
- [Entity Model Features](https://modrinth.com/mod/entity-model-features)
- [EntityTextureFeatures](https://modrinth.com/mod/entitytexturefeatures)

Don't worry, though! They are **not required**, but just recommended. Most (~85%) of the other textures will display fine, such as the swords, tools, and items!

It should be noted that even though our [wiki](https://stardustlabs.miraheze.org/wiki/Incendium) shows the Voltaic Trident as having a texture, that texture is not implemented.

## Can I translate it to my own language?
Yes! This resourcepack provides translations for several languages just by using it. They are added the the main resourcepack periodically. Click the button below to visit our translation website - this is the *only* place we accept translation contributions.

### Credits
- Kuma, for making the original [Biome Name Fix](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/stardust-biome-name-fix) resourcepack. This handled just the biomes, until it was merged into Sparkles.
- Tera, for the creation of the original Incendium Optional Resourcepack. It has now been "recreated" into this one.
